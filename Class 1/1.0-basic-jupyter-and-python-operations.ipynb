    "- Write comments.\n",
    "- Start small. Rather than attempting to write the entire function at one time, think logically about what you need to do and write each step out. Check your code after each step to make sure what you believe is happening is actually happening!\n",
    "- Start by getting the answer, then try to get that answer more quickly.\n",
    "- Before production, try to break it. Put in positive numbers, negative numbers, 0, strings, dictionaries, lists, blanks - see what breaks and how you can fix it.\n",
    "- As you work with more complicated functions, you might find that it often makes sense to write the body (inside) of the function first, *then* define the function and its arguments. Trying to foresee every argument and input you need before typing can be difficult.\n",
    "- **Avoid deleting your code if you can - always. Comment it out, save it in a different file, move it to a different cell if you have to, but try to never delete a fragment of code unless it's 100% worthless and you've checked with your friends and it's been a decade since you touched that fragment.**\n",
